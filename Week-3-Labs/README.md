### Week 3 lab

Input is essential for any web application! 

In this week's lab you are tasked with creating a react application that shows a number and has two buttons one with "-" and the other with "+". When the "-" button is clicked the number should be decremented by 1 and when the "+" button is clicked the number should be incremented by 1. The initial value for the number should be zero.
