### Week 2 Lab A â€“ Installing React Modules 

Libraries and modules are a key part of software development. Rarely an application's code is entirely written by a standalone developer!

In this lab you will install a node module into your React application to facilitate http requests.

A fantastic resource for finding node modules to satisfy a piece of functionality that is required by an application can be found at https://www.npmjs.com/

Note: This lab is only about installing the module and not using it in your code. This will be explored in later classes & when using npmjs. Please make sure the module is compatible with React and not "React Native", as React Native is different from React.

### Week 2 Lab B - React Application with 2 pages 

Most applications have many different pages containing different content that be accessed on those pages. 

In this lab you will make a React application with 2 pages: 

The first page should act as splash screen for you and should contain a list of links to your favourite websites or websites that you frequently visit. Each link should have a name, a short description and the link to the webpage/website/web application that you frequently visit. 

The second page is a shopping list of items that you plan to buy, each item should have a link to where the item can be bought from, a name for the item.
